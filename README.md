# hacker-rank-Fibonacci-Modified
Given three integers, t1, t2, and N, compute and print the Nth  term of a modified Fibonacci sequence.

```
Example:
t1 = 0
t2 = 1
n = 6

where a^^b is a to the power of b.

• t3 = 0 + 1^^2 = 1
• t4 = 1 + 1^^2 = 2
• t5 = 1 + 2^^2 = 5
• t6 = 2 + 5^^2 = 27

Constraints
• 0 ≤ t1, t2 ≤ 2
• 3 ≤ n ≤ 20
• t(n)  may far exceed the range of a -bit integer.

Sample Input:
0 1 5

Sample Output:
5
